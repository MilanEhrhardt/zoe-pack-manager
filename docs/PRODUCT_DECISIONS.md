## Decisions

### Belief engine framework (Phase 3B, export only)

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Decision** | Read-only belief scaffolding in export and analytics summary only; no volunteer UI, no SPE, no recommendations in Phase 3B |
| **Date** | 2026-06-25 |
| **Context** | Phase 3A supplies quantity-weighted measurements and an `impactReadiness` gate. Before any operational impact judgements or SPE work, the codebase needs a stable place where future beliefs will live — with cautious copy, deterministic confidence, and explicit limitations. |
| **Decision** | Add Phase 3B pipeline: `computeBeliefEngine(ctx)` consuming `itemConfidence`, `packingHabits`, `operationalIntelligence`, and `synthetic: !!state.sampleData`. Builders: `computeItemBalanceBeliefs`, `computeShortageBeliefs`, `computeHabitBeliefs`, `computeRecipeAlignmentBeliefs`, `computeReadinessBeliefs`, plus `computeBeliefConfidence` and `beliefEngineSummaryConcise`. Export `beliefEngine` in AI Data Pack; analytics summary includes `beliefEngineSummary`. Default actionability `observe_only` or `monitor`; never `ready_for_review` when synthetic or `impactReadiness.readyForImpactJudgement` is false. `readyForRecommendations` false in sandbox. Cautious copy only — currently believe, evidence suggests, may, appears, monitor. No localStorage schema change. No changes to commit flows, stock math, recipes, render functions, or volunteer UI. |
| **Reasoning** | Defines structural framework for future reasoning without overclaiming from sparse or synthetic data. Keeps measurement (3A) separate from belief scaffolding (3B) and deferred impact judgements. |
| **Alternatives Considered** | **Evidence Fusion Engine** — deferred; user chose belief framework first. **Volunteer-facing beliefs** — rejected. **Persisted belief state** — rejected; schema change forbidden. **ready_for_review in sandbox** — rejected. |
| **Status** | Accepted |

### Operational intelligence foundation (Phase 3A, export only)

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Decision** | Read-only operational measurement layer in export and analytics summary only; no volunteer UI in Phase 3A |
| **Date** | 2026-06-25 |
| **Context** | Packing Habits describe behavioural patterns; item confidence describes trust. Ops and future SPE need quantity-weighted operational facts — which habits consumed stock, which donations may have enabled packs, which recounts shifted confidence, which items carry risk — before any system can judge whether actions were “good” or “bad.” |
| **Decision** | Add Phase 3A pipeline: `computeOperationalIntelligence()` → sections `buildImpact`, `substitutionImpact`, `optionalImpact`, `donationImpact`, `recountImpact`, `stockRisk`, `impactReadiness`, `limitations`. Count packs via `tx.qty` and substitutions via `packCount` × `qtyPerPack`, not build-event counts. Default to production-only (`isTesterUser`); export `allMovements` where useful. Reuse `computeBuildStockPlan()` read-only for consumption. Cross-link packing habits where available. `impactReadiness` gates Phase 3B judgement. Cautious language only — may, appears, estimated, not enough evidence. No recommendations. Export `operationalIntelligence` in AI Data Pack; analytics summary includes `operationalIntelligenceSummary`. No localStorage schema change. No changes to commit flows, stock math, recipes, or volunteer UI. |
| **Reasoning** | Separates measurement from judgement. Gives Phase 3B Operational Impact Engine structured ingredients without alarming Janet or overclaiming from sparse/synthetic data. |
| **Alternatives Considered** | **Jump straight to Phase 3B recommendations** — rejected; insufficient epistemic foundation. **Persist operational state** — rejected; schema change forbidden. **Event-count metrics** — rejected; misrepresents qty-10 builds and packCount substitutions. |
| **Status** | Accepted |

### Evidence-based habit trend classification

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Decision** | Replace `unstable`/directional sub-labels with `trend` + `evidence` + `trendReason` |
| **Date** | 2026-06-25 |
| **Context** | Phase 2 labelled low-sample changes (e.g. 1/10 → 3/10) as `unstable`, implying volunteer inconsistency when the dataset was simply too small. |
| **Decision** | `trend`: too_early_to_tell, emerging, established, declining, stable. `evidence`: too_early, early, sufficient. Add human `trendReason`. Remove `unstable`, `new`, `strengthening`, `weakening`, `disappearing` from export. Exclude `too_early_to_tell` from `topThreeInsights`. Raw `trendRows` remain unfiltered. |
| **Reasoning** | Separates “we don't yet know” from “behaviour appears to be emerging/established/declining.” Avoids blaming volunteers for insufficient data. |
| **Alternatives Considered** | **Single combined trend field** — rejected; user approved two-field model. **Keep unstable for flip-flops** — rejected; conflates concepts. |
| **Status** | Accepted |

### Packing habit trend insight noise filter

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Decision** | Filter `topThreeInsights` aggressively; keep full raw `trendRows` in export |
| **Date** | 2026-06-25 |
| **Context** | Phase 2 `topThreeInsights` surfaced low-confidence one-off patterns (e.g. 1/10 vs 0/10) with misleading “much more common” copy. |
| **Decision** | `topThreeInsights` only includes insights where confidence is medium/high, OR recentCount ≥ 3, OR previousCount ≥ 3, OR \|deltaPercentage\| ≥ 30; explicitly excludes one-off patterns (recentCount ≤ 1 AND previousCount ≤ 1). Full `trends.trendRows` and `allInsights` arrays remain unfiltered in AI Data Pack. Low-count emerging/strengthening copy says “may not mean anything yet” instead of “much more common.” |
| **Reasoning** | Ops summary should highlight actionable patterns; Milan retains full technical data for analysis. |
| **Alternatives Considered** | **Filter all insights** — rejected; loses admin audit trail. **Raise window minimum to 25** — rejected; sandbox has insufficient history. |
| **Status** | Accepted |

### Packing habits behavioural trends (Phase 2 / 2.1, export only)

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Decision** | Windowed habit trend analysis in export and analytics summary only; no volunteer UI in Phase 2 |
| **Date** | 2026-06-25 |
| **Context** | Phase 1 describes what habits exist. Ops and future SPE need to know whether behaviour is emerging, strengthening, stable, weakening, or disappearing — without Bayesian models, RL, or volunteer-facing dashboards. |
| **Decision** | Add Phase 2 pipeline after Phase 1: `deriveHistoricalHabitWindows` → `compareHabitWindows` → `computeHabitTrendClassification` → `computeHabitCauseProbabilities` → `buildTrendReason` → `generateHabitInsights` → `packingHabitTrendSummary`. Per packKey, compare non-overlapping recent/previous windows (25/25, else 20/20, else 10/10). Classify trends by percentage-point deltas. Probabilistic `possibleCauses` (stock shortage, recount discrepancy, seasonality, recipe change candidate, volunteer preference, unknown — 1–3 ranked, confidences sum to 1.0). `confidenceBand` + `confidenceProbability`; `insightQualityScore` for ranking; `belief` / `beliefPrevious` / `beliefDelta` (belief = confidenceProbability until Phase 3). Five-section human insights. Extend `packingHabits.observations` with trend fields; add `packingHabits.allInsights` (unfiltered export-only); analytics summary includes `packingHabitTrends`. Excludes Milan tester builds. Human language only. No localStorage schema change. No changes to stock math, recipes, or volunteer UI. |
| **Reasoning** | Smallest step from description to interpretation; deterministic and testable; feeds SPE recipe-importance and ops review without alarming Janet. Phase 2.1 improves epistemic honesty without changing volunteer workflows. |
| **Alternatives Considered** | **Fold trends into Phase 1 observations only** — rejected; loses insight narrative and summary counts. **Persist rolling habit state** — rejected; schema change forbidden. **Bayesian/RL models** — explicitly deferred to Phase 3. **Single winning cause** — rejected in 2.1; multiple hypotheses coexist with weighted confidence. |
| **Status** | Accepted |

### Packing habits intelligence (Phase 1, export only)

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Decision** | Production-only packing habit observations in export and analytics summary only; no volunteer UI in Phase 1 |
| **Date** | 2026-06-25 |
| **Context** | Volunteers develop substitutions, usual optionals, custom extras, and omissions that may diverge from written recipes. This signal is buried in raw build transactions. SPE Phase 1 needs recipe-importance and habit signals without alarming Janet or changing stock math. |
| **Decision** | Add read-only pipeline: `extractPackingHabitEvents` → `computePackingHabitPatterns` → `generatePackingHabitObservations` → `packingHabitSummary`. Patterns: substitution pairs, optional usage, custom extras, omissions. Thresholds: min 5 production builds per pack, min 3 occurrences, min 40%. Export includes `packingHabits` in AI Data Pack; analytics summary includes `packingHabitsSummary`. Excludes Milan tester builds via `isTesterUser`. Human `volunteerText` with counts only — no “drift detected” language. No localStorage schema change. No changes to `commitBuild`, `computeBuildStockPlan`, or volunteer UI. |
| **Reasoning** | Mirrors item-confidence Increment A: testable read-model, ops-facing export, SPE-ready. Milan sandbox will show few observations until enough Janet/Judy builds exist — correct behaviour. |
| **Alternatives Considered** | **Extend existing `optionUsage`** — rejected; includes tester builds, no substitution detail, no thresholds. **Persist habit profiles in localStorage** — rejected; schema change forbidden. |
| **Status** | Accepted |

### Item-level confidence (Increment A, export only)

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Decision** | Deterministic per-item confidence in export and analytics summary only; no volunteer UI in Increment A |
| **Date** | 2026-06-25 |
| **Context** | Janet's core problem is trust in stock numbers, not arithmetic. DESIGN_PRINCIPLES and THE_ZOE_PROJECT_BIBLE call for a future Confidence Meter. SPE Phase 1 needs belief-state signals without volunteer-facing dashboards. |
| **Decision** | Add read-only `computeAllItemConfidence()` derived from transactions + item/recipe metadata. Each item gets `confidenceScore` (0–100), `confidenceBand`, `confidenceReason`, `recommendedAction`, and `volunteerLabel`. Export includes `volunteerConfidence` (excludes Milan tester builds) and `allMovementsConfidence`. Analytics summary includes `confidenceSummary`. Sample data caps volunteer scores at 79. No localStorage schema change. No UI on Home, Pack Creation, or Stock view yet. |
| **Reasoning** | Smallest safe foundation for SPE and ops analysis without changing stock math or alarming Janet. Split views keep tester pack deductions out of production confidence. |
| **Alternatives Considered** | **Recency-only labels** — rejected as too coarse. **Volunteer UI in Phase 1** — rejected; Increment B deferred until field validation. **Persisted belief state** — rejected; schema migration risk. |
| **Status** | Accepted |

### Milan tester analytics separation

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Decision** | Add Milan as packer option; tag tester sessions in analytics without deleting data |
| **Date** | 2026-06-25 |
| **Context** | Developer testing (Milan) polluted volunteer usability analysis. Full login/auth is out of scope. |
| **Decision** | Milan appears in the existing packer dropdown. `isTesterUser("Milan")` tags analytics events and AI Data Pack exports with `sessionUser`, `currentSelectedUser`, `isTesterSession`. Summary splits `productionVolunteerSessions`, `testerSessions`, `unknownSessions`. No passwords, accounts, or auth. Stock and pack logic unchanged. |
| **Reasoning** | Smallest safe separation: one extra dropdown name, additive analytics fields, future exports can exclude tester sessions. Janet/Judy workflow unchanged — no “admin login” language. |
| **Alternatives Considered** | **devMode toggle** — rejected for now; easy to forget. **Separate app build** — rejected; too heavy. **Delete tester analytics** — rejected; Milan needs history for debugging. |
| **Status** | Accepted |

### SPE is a future intelligence layer, not a Phase 1 UI feature

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Decision** | Document SPE as future roadmap; do not implement yet |
| **Date** | 2026-06-25 |
| **Context** | Explored multi-objective recommendation systems inspired by large-scale recommender architecture (candidate generation, Pareto filtering, context policies). SPE-Ω captured as theoretical north star in `THE_ZOE_PROJECT_BIBLE.md`. |
| **Decision** | SPE and SPE-Ω are documented in `THE_ZOE_PROJECT_BIBLE.md` only. No engine code, no Janet whisper, no UI changes until core workflows are field-validated. |
| **Reasoning** | Current priority is stabilising Janet's core workflows. SPE is valuable but premature as a visible UI layer. |
| **Alternatives Considered** | **Implement Phase 1 now** — rejected; distracts from Pack Creation / donation / deliver field validation. **Do not document** — rejected; would lose design work. |
| **Status** | Accepted / Deferred |

### Entry screen Increment A (four verbs, no dashboard)

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Decision** | Simplify entry screen to calm “What happened today?” with four primary verbs; move ops tools behind **Need something else?** |
| **Date** | 2026-06-25 |
| **Context** | Home headline matched storeroom-memory direction but the body behaved like an inventory dashboard (pack counts, LOW stock, nudges, full stock list). Fourth verb (stock correction) was buried in Admin. |
| **Decision** | Ship **Increment A** of the Recommended “Today loop” plan: primary surface shows We packed packs / A donation arrived / We delivered packs / I counted something again. Remove dashboard cards from entry. Relocate undo, stock levels view, backup, and analytics to discreet **Need something else?** Defer resume card, draft persistence, post-save loop, and today summary (Increment B). Render/CSS/navigation only — no business logic changes. |
| **Reasoning** | Aligns entry UX with DESIGN_PRINCIPLES without the regression risk of Increment B before field validation. Volunteers see verbs, not inventory intelligence, on open. |
| **Alternatives Considered** | **Conservative:** label tweaks only — rejected; dashboard contradiction remained. **Radical:** timeline-first, no home — rejected for Janet; deferred to Phase 2+. **Full Today loop (Increment B):** approved direction but explicitly deferred. |
| **Status** | Accepted |

### Pack Creation screen redesign (common extras on main screen)

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Decision** | Move recipe optional toggles to the main Pack Creation screen; narrow “Add something different” to swaps, omissions, and unlisted extras only; remove admin footer from build/add-item views |
| **Date** | 2026-06-24 |
| **Context** | June user testing showed common extras (deo, tissues, wet wipes, hand cream) buried behind three taps in the add-item subflow. Analytics showed friction on `add-item-done-bottom` and admin distraction during packing. |
| **Decision** | Ship the **Recommended** option from the Pack Creation redesign plan: render/bind/CSS only — no changes to `commitBuild`, `checkBuild`, or stock logic. Remove `choice-optional` menu path (redirect legacy `addItemStep === "optional"` to main screen). Add `choice-extra` for unlisted custom extras. |
| **Reasoning** | Restores the quick multi-select happy path Janet/Judy need without repeating the rejected “Today's Changes” one-by-one pattern. Rare exceptions stay in a slimmer subflow. |
| **Alternatives Considered** | **Conservative:** copy/label tweaks only — extras still two taps away. **Radical:** wizard or one-item-per-screen — rejected; repeats failed Today's Changes UX. |
| **Status** | Accepted |

### Lead Product Engineer workflow

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Decision** | Adopt Lead Product Engineer workflow with three-solution proposals, approval gate, and auto-commit |
| **Date** | 2025-06-25 |
| **Context** | AI agents were implementing requests without challenging assumptions or waiting for approval. The existing six-phase Lead Engineer workflow lacked formal solution comparison and a hard approval gate before coding. |
| **Decision** | Rename role to Lead Product Engineer. For features and non-trivial changes: challenge the request, propose Conservative / Recommended / Radical solutions with trade-offs, recommend one, and wait for approval before coding. For trivial fixes: short plan + approval. Auto-commit when Phases 3–5 complete (design review passed or trade-off documented). Codify in `.cursor/rules/lead-product-engineer.mdc`, `.cursor/rules.md`, and `docs/CURSOR_RULES.md`. |
| **Reasoning** | Volunteers depend on stable behaviour; order-taking agents risk regressions. Three options force deliberate trade-off thinking without the overhead of a full proposal log. Auto-commit improves velocity while design review and doc updates remain gates. |
| **Alternatives Considered** | **Conservative:** conversation-only adoption (no doc changes) — rejected because behaviour would not persist across sessions. **Radical:** separate workflow bible + mandatory proposal log in PRODUCT_DECISIONS — rejected as doc fatigue for a single-file volunteer app. |
| **Status** | Accepted |
